Provides methods to calculate the angle between the hands of an analog clock when a time is input

-The angle between the hour and minute hand assuming that the hour hand does not move at all until it need to shift to the next hour 

-The angle between the hour and minute hand assuming that the hour hand moves in proportion to the minutes within an hour
